Task description:

New feature (write up)
We want to add the ability for the users to upload a video review of their stay. Without writing any code describe what UI and UX considerations that should be top of mind when implementing this feature.
Create a markdown document within a docs folder with the details.

Feature details:

1. The user should get an option triggered for review, at their home page and their reservations only for the hotels they have booked through their accounts.
2. Review submission should have following fields as input params:
    a. Review rating - 1-2 starts
    b. Recommend for next time: Yes/No
    c. Comments section, for details on their stay and comments/suggestions to be added for the location owner.


UX:

1. User should be easily able to see their bookings/hotels review option
2. They can either give a detailed or simple rating based review
3. Video upload option should be limited to a fixed size (file size)
4. They should be able to upload single/multiple videos with one click.
